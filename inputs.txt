﻿Pumping lemma If A is a regular language, then there is a number p (the
pumping length) where if .s is any string in A of length at least 1), then .9 may be
divided into three pieces, .9 = :zryz, satisfying the following conditions:

1. for eachz' Z O, my’iz E A,

2. |y| > O, and

3. IIL'yI S 1).
Recall the notation where |s| represents the length of string 3, yi means that '23
copies of y are concatenated together, and 3/” equals a.

When 5 is divided into myz, either :1: or 2 may be 6:, but condition 2 says that
y # 5. Observe that without condition 2 the theorem would be trivially true.
Condition 3 states that the pieces a: and 3/ together have length at most p. It is an
extra technical condition that we occasionally ﬁnd useful when proving certain
languages to be nonregular. See Example 1.74 for an application of condition 3.
